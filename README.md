# org.anc.maven.groovy-parent-pom
Parent POM for ANC Groovy projects.

The code in this repository originally lived in the ANC's Subversion repository at [https://www.anc.org/dev/groovy-parent-pom/trunk](https://www.anc.org/dev/groovy-parent-pom/trunk).  For some reason using GitHub's repository importer resulted 3,005 commit to this repo, most from names I don't recognize containing 0 files and 0 changes. This made any real commit history impossible to find.  So if you *really* need to go back in time you will have to go back to the above Subversion repository.
